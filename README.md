# WaitFreeQueue
A C implementation of a wait free queue based on [this paper](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~erez/Papers/wfquque-ppopp.pdf)

This is a far from finished project, not fully implemented.

### TODOS
	- Current status is 20 compile errors, fix each of these
	- Test file currently does not work, segfaults with multiple threads
	- Once test file is working, verify our implementation
	- Add memory management, there is currently a lot of leakage
	- Improve Documentation, and test/verify thoroughly
